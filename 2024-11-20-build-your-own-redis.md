## Build your own Redis 

I ended the day taking this [Course](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/redis/introduction?track=python). 

It says > Redis is an in-memory data structure store often used as a database, cache, message broker and streaming engine. In this challenge you'll build your own Redis server that is capable of serving basic commands, reading RDB files and more.
